Keylogger using pynput

This project demonstrates a simple keylogger implemented in Python using the pynput library. It listens for keyboard events and logs keystrokes, including special keys and regular character inputs.

Key Release Detection: Captures and logs key release events.
Exit Mechanism: Stops the keylogger when the Esc key is released.
